# burger

This project allows a user to order whatever type of burger they want, and eat it.  The project maintains a database of the burgers, and whether they have been devoured or not.  

The user can start by loading the page and entering a burger they would like to order in the text box.  Once they submit the order, it appears on the left side of the page, in the burgers to be devoured section.  If the user clicks the devour button, the burger is transferred to the devoured section.

If you would like to use this project and need help, look into handlebars, orm, mysql, heroku deployment, express, and mvc folder structure.
